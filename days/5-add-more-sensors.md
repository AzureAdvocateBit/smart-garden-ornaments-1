> **This day has sections that require someone confident in setting up and programming a Raspberry Pi, and sections requiring someone confident using block based programming on a BBC micro:bit. You will also need access to IoT Central to see the temperature data**

Yesterday you built the smart garden ornaments and set them up around your house. Today's project is to add more sensors to capture more data.

So far you've used the temperature sensor built into the micro:bit. But this is not the limit - there are so many more sensors you can use to gather data! Todays part will cover three sensors - one on board and two external. You will learn how to add a new sensor and start gathering data

The steps you'll take to do this are:

* Build or wire up the sensor if required
* Add code to the micro:bit to gather data from the sensor
* Add code to the Pi to understand the sensor value
* Add the new sensor value to IoT Central and show it on the dashboard
